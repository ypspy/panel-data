"""
This code is to extract related values from a specified forlder containing DART scraping results.
Formerly utilizing integrated CSV library, but to enhance its conveniency I adopt external module named 'XlsxWriter(*)'
Also notice that the body of codes for listing files came from clever answers on StackOverflow. (**)
I'm not explaining the code line by line as almost every idea came from above refrence.
Finally, this code works well with my scraping and analysis tools. It means you can't easily find general purpose of some functions of this code.
